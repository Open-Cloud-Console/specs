## Overview

As a user, I want to apply labels to my storage buckets, so I can efficiently organize, categorize, and manage them.

## Narrative

1. As a user (who manages multiple cloud storage buckets),
1. I want to be able to apply, update, and remove labels from my buckets,
1. So that I can easily organize them into categories, facilitate filtering, and allocate them to different cost centers for management purposes.

## UI Components Needed

UI components related with this user story and where to use them on bucket-related contexts:

1. Bucket Labels List
    - subclass of "Pills List"
    -  to be used on the bucket details component
    -  description
        - a list of the first labels of a bucket
        - with a button to display all when the number of labels is too large
        - with a button to launch labels management UI
1. Bucket Labels Input
   - subclass of "Pills Input"
   - to be used on the bucket creation form component
   - description
       - a text input to type labels separated by a separator
       - when the separator is typed, the label text becomes a pill with a clear button x
       - there is an autocomplete interface to help the user reuse labels that have been used before
       - there is validation on change to hint visually about invalid label values
       - there is a limit of how many labels can be on a list
